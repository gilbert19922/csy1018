        My Experience of Web Dev
      </p>
    </div>
 
    <div class="textbackground"> 
      <p class="maintext">
    While developing my website I knew my original understanding of web dev was highly lacking in places. I found some of the in class tasks quite easy to go through in the beginning but as it became more complicated I felt I was struggling to keep up with the content being covered. However working with a team I found that I could bounce ideas off of my friends to develop my understanding. I feel that now at the end of the assignment I have a basic understanding of how to build a website, whether it is to a high level of build is another question.
    <br>
    <br>
    I developed my website to have a consistent layout throughout the pages as it is a recognised standard from websites I frequently use, some examples of this are: Humble Bundle, YouTube, G2A and Reddit. The consistent layout makes it easy to both navigate and find the information you are looking for on the page.
    <br>
    <br>
    One of the more difficult things to come up with was the colour scheme as what looks good to one person may not look good to another for example my original choice of a soft pink, yellow and green didn’t work well for colour blind people, so I have changed to soft colours of green, 2 shades of blue and orange. Using white on the button hover with black text as it is very clear which button you are hovering over.
    <br>
    <br>
    I also found coming up with ideas for the content hard as I wasn’t sure if the way I was doing things was correct. However having discussed and shown/viewed my colleagues work I found that we were all doing similar types of things so I figured I was on the right lines. I must admit that solving some of the problems I had with positioning of items on my pages was an absolute pain, and the age old joke of, person 1 “I solved the problem.” Person 2 “What did you do?” Person 1 “I have no idea.” Applied very heavily to my website.
    <br>
    <br>
    The conclusion I have come to is that my website designing and building skills are not brilliant but I have tried my best and I hope that I manage to pass.
